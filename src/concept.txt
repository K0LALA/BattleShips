You have a 10x10 grid, your first task will be to place five ships of different sizes on your grid giving two positions (starting position and ending position in order).
The computer does the same and the game starts.

The starting player is chosen randomly.
When it is your turn, you need to pick a position for where you are going to hit in the computer's grid.
If you hit a ship, it is "Hit!".
To make a ship sink, you need to hit all of his cases, and it is "Sunk SHIP_NAME!".
And if you miss, it is "Miss!"

The first to eliminate all enemy's ships win.
